# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe game in Python

2 separate files: a .py file with Python code and a .ipynb Jupyter notebook file.  Both have identical code just in different formats.

The program contains several functions that when run together allow two players to play Tic Tac Toe.

The first function creates and sets up the board.  Each space on the Tic Tac Toe board is assigned a number (1-9) based on the number pad.

The second function allows a player to choose X or O for their marker.

The third function places the marker on the board.

The fourth function checks if someone has won the game.

The fifth function randomly determines who goes first.

The sixth function checks if a space is empty and if a move can be made there.

The seventh function checks if the entire board is full and if the game must end in a tie.

The eighth function allows a player to choose a space on the board.

The ninth function asks the player if they wish to replay the game.

The last piece of the code combines all the functions and uses While loops to actually play an entire game.
